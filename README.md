## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software dev who currently specializes at javascript and c++.

I currently am studying Computer Science at McGill University and am expected to graduate late 2027.

I will be working for Hydro Ottawa until December '25.

My current projects are primarily in private repositories, but they concern my work and another large project involving modding Geometry Dash in c++.
